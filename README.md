## Theory

### The Ising Model

The Ising model describes a lattice of spins, where each spin $s_i$ can take a value of either $+1$ (spin up) or $-1$ (spin down). The spins interact with their nearest neighbors on a 2D lattice, and the system's energy is determined by the following Hamiltonian:

$$
H = -J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} s_i s_j - \mu H \sum_i s_i
$$

Where:

- $J$ is the interaction energy between neighboring spins.
- $s_i$ is the spin of site $i$.
- The sum $\langle i,j \rangle$ runs over all pairs of neighboring spins.
- $\mu$ is the magnetic moment of the lattice.
- $H$ is the external magnetic field.

The system is studied using the Metropolis algorithm, which probabilistically accepts or rejects spin flips based on the change in energy. The probability of accepting a flip is given by the Boltzmann factor:

$$
P(\Delta E) = \begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } \Delta E < 0 \\
e^{-\Delta E / k_B T}, & \text{if } \Delta E \geq 0
\end{cases}
$$

Where $\Delta E$ is the change in energy due to the flip, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature. The simulation evolves the system to equilibrium and measures macroscopic quantities like magnetization, energy, heat capacity, and susceptibility.

### Metropolis Algorithm

The Metropolis algorithm is a Monte Carlo method used to simulate physical systems. It works by iterating over all spins in the lattice and attempting to flip each spin. If the flip decreases the energy, it is always accepted. If the flip increases the energy, it is accepted with a probability $P(\Delta E) = e^{-\Delta E / k_B T}$. This probabilistic acceptance ensures that the system can reach thermal equilibrium at a given temperature.

The algorithm is used to sample configurations of the system according to the Boltzmann distribution, allowing the calculation of macroscopic properties like the average magnetization, energy, and heat capacity.

### Heat Capacity and Susceptibility

The heat capacity $C$ and susceptibility $\chi$ are two important thermodynamic quantities that can be derived from the energy and magnetization fluctuations, respectively.

The heat capacity is related to the fluctuation in energy:

$$
C = \frac{\langle E^2 \rangle - \langle E \rangle^2}{k_B T^2}
$$

The susceptibility is related to the fluctuation in magnetization:

$$
\chi = \frac{\langle M^2 \rangle - \langle M \rangle^2}{k_B T}
$$
